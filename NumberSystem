# 📘 Number System – Basics

## 🔹 What is Number System?
A number system is a way of representing numbers using digits and symbols.

## 🔹 Types of Numbers
| Type | Description | Example |
|----|----|----|
| Natural Numbers | Counting numbers starting from 1 | 1, 2, 3 |
| Whole Numbers | Natural numbers + 0 | 0, 1, 2 |
| Integers | Positive, negative & zero | -2, 0, 5 |
| Rational Numbers | Can be written as p/q | 3/4 |
| Irrational Numbers | Cannot be written as p/q | √2 |

## 🔹 Important Formulas
- Sum of first n natural numbers = **n(n+1)/2**
- Sum of first n even numbers = **n(n+1)**
- Sum of first n odd numbers = **n²**


# 📘 Divisibility Rules – Number System

Divisibility rules help determine whether a number is divisible by another number **without performing division**.  

## 🔢 Divisibility Rules (1 to 12)

### ✅ Divisible by 1
**Rule:** Every number is divisible by 1.

📌 Example: 457 ÷ 1 

### ✅ Divisible by 2
**Rule:** Last digit must be even (0, 2, 4, 6, 8)

📌 Example: 246 → last digit 6 

### ✅ Divisible by 3
**Rule:** Sum of digits is divisible by 3

📌 Example: 372  
3 + 7 + 2 = 12 

### ✅ Divisible by 4
**Rule:** Last two digits are divisible by 4

📌 Example: 1316 → 16 ÷ 4 

### ✅ Divisible by 5
**Rule:** Last digit is 0 or 5

📌 Example: 890  
📌 Example: 345 

### ✅ Divisible by 6
**Rule:** Number must be divisible by **both 2 and 3**

📌 Example: 114  
- Even 
- 1 + 1 + 4 = 6  

### ✅ Divisible by 7
**Rule:**  
1. Separate the last digit  
2. Double it  
3. Subtract from remaining number  
4. If result is divisible by 7, the number is divisible

📌 Example: 203  
- Last digit = 3 → 3 × 2 = 6  
- 20 − 6 = 14 

### ✅ Divisible by 8
**Rule:** Last three digits are divisible by 8

📌 Example: 4560 → 560 ÷ 8 

### ✅ Divisible by 9
**Rule:** Sum of digits is divisible by 9

📌 Example: 729  
7 + 2 + 9 = 18 

### ✅ Divisible by 10
**Rule:** Last digit must be 0

📌 Example: 1230 

### ✅ Divisible by 11
**Rule:**  
Difference between the sum of digits at odd and even positions is **0 or divisible by 11**

📌 Example: 121  
(1 + 1) − 2 = 0 

### ✅ Divisible by 12
**Rule:** Number must be divisible by **both 3 and 4**

📌 Example: 144  
- 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 
- 44 ÷ 4 

## 📌 Key Shortcuts (Very Important)
- **3 & 9** → Digit sum
- **4 & 8** → Check only last digits
- **6** → Divisible by 2 and 3
- **12** → Divisible by 3 and 4

# 📘 HCF and LCM – Number System

## 🔹 Basic Definitions

### ✅ HCF (Highest Common Factor)
HCF is the **greatest number** that divides two or more numbers **exactly**.Also called:- GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)

📌 Example:  
HCF of 12 and 18 = **6**

### ✅ LCM (Least Common Multiple)
LCM is the **smallest number** that is a **multiple of two or more numbers**.

📌 Example:  
LCM of 12 and 18 = **36**

## 🔢 Methods to Find HCF and LCM

### 🔸 Method 1: Prime Factorization

Steps:
1. Write prime factors of each number
2. **HCF:** Take common primes with lowest power
3. **LCM:** Take all primes with highest power

### 🔸 Method 2: Division Method (For HCF)

Steps:
1. Divide larger number by smaller
2. Continue till remainder = 0
3. Last divisor = HCF

## 📌 Important Formula

### ⭐ Relation Between HCF and LCM
For two numbers **a** and **b**: HCF × LCM = a × b
HCF = HCF of numerators / LCM of denominators
LCM = LCM of numerators / HCF of denominators

# 📘 Remainders – Number System
When a number **A** is divided by **B**:A = (B × Q) + R

## 🔢 Basic Remainder Rules

### ✅ Rule 1: Same Remainder Property If:a ≡ r (mod n)
## 🔹 Remainders in Addition:(a + b) mod n = [(a mod n) + (b mod n)] mod n

# 📘 Unit Digits & Cyclicity 
## 🔹 What is a Unit Digit?
The **unit digit** of a number is the **last digit** (ones place).

## 🔹 Basic Rules

### ✅ Rule 1: Unit digit depends only on the last digit
To find the unit digit of any power, consider **only the last digit of the base**.

### ✅ Rule 2: Powers repeat in cycles
The unit digits of powers follow a **fixed repeating pattern** called **cyclicity**.

## 🔹 How to Use Cyclicity

### Step-by-step Method
1. Identify the **last digit** of the base
2. Note the **cycle length**
3. Divide the exponent by cycle length
4. Use remainder to find unit digit

## 🔹 Special Case: Remainder = 0
If remainder = 0, take the **last term of the cycle**.

## 🔹 Negative and Zero Exponents

- Any number⁰ = **1**
- 0 raised to any positive power = **0**
