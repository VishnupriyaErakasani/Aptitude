# 📘 RATIO AND PROPORTION
---

## 1️⃣ BASIC DEFINITIONS

### 🔹 Ratio
A **ratio** compares two quantities of the same kind.

Example:
- Ratio of 10 and 20 = 10 : 20 = **1 : 2**

👉 Ratio has **no unit**

---

### 🔹 Proportion
When **two ratios are equal**, they form a proportion.

Example:
- 2 : 3 = 4 : 6  
- Written as **2 : 3 :: 4 : 6**

---

## 2️⃣ TYPES OF RATIOS

### ✔ Simple Ratio
Direct comparison  
Example: 5 : 10 = 1 : 2

---

### ✔ Compound Ratio
Product of two or more ratios

Example:
- (2 : 3) and (4 : 5)
- Compound ratio = (2×4) : (3×5) = **8 : 15**

---

### ✔ Duplicate Ratio
Square of ratio

If a : b  
Duplicate = a² : b²

---

### ✔ Sub-duplicate Ratio
Square root of ratio

If a : b  
Sub-duplicate = √a : √b

---

### ✔ Triplicate Ratio
Cube of ratio

a³ : b³

---

## 3️⃣ PROPERTIES OF PROPORTION

If  
a : b = c : d

Then:

- a × d = b × c  (Cross multiplication)
- (a + b) : b = (c + d) : d
- (a − b) : b = (c − d) : d

---

## 4️⃣ CONTINUED PROPORTION

Three numbers a, b, c are in continued proportion if:
\[
a : b = b : c
\]

👉 Then:
\[
b^2 = a \times c
\]

---

## 5️⃣ INVERSE PROPORTION

If one quantity **increases**, the other **decreases**.

Examples:
- Speed and Time
- Workers and Days

Formula:
\[
x_1 y_1 = x_2 y_2
\]

---

## 6️⃣ DIRECT PROPORTION

Both quantities increase or decrease together.

Example:
- Cost ∝ Quantity

Formula:
\[
\frac{x_1}{x_2} = \frac{y_1}{y_2}
\]

---

## 7️⃣ DIVISION IN A GIVEN RATIO

### 🔹 Total Value = S  
### 🔹 Ratio = a : b

Then:
- First part = \( \frac{a}{a+b} \times S \)
- Second part = \( \frac{b}{a+b} \times S \)

---

## 8️⃣ COMBINING RATIOS (IMPORTANT)

If:
- A : B = m : n
- B : C = p : q

Make B same:

A : B = m×p : n×p  
B : C = n×p : n×q  

So:
\[
A : B : C = m p : n p : n q
\]

---

## 9️⃣ IMPORTANT FORMULAS SUMMARY

| Concept | Formula |
|------|------|
| Ratio | a : b |
| Proportion | a : b = c : d |
| Continued proportion | b² = ac |
| Direct proportion | x₁/x₂ = y₁/y₂ |
| Inverse proportion | x₁y₁ = x₂y₂ |
| Division of amount | (ratio part / sum) × total |

## 🔟 MODEL QUESTIONS WITH SHORTCUTS

---

### Q1️⃣ Simplify 18 : 24
Divide by 6  
👉 **3 : 4**

---

### Q2️⃣ If a : b = 3 : 5, find (2a + b) : (a + 2b)

Substitute:
- a = 3
- b = 5

(6+5):(3+10) = 11 : 13  
👉 **Answer: 11 : 13**

---

### Q3️⃣ Divide ₹720 in ratio 2 : 3

Total parts = 5  
First = 2/5 × 720 = 288  
Second = 432

---

### Q4️⃣ A : B = 4 : 5, B : C = 6 : 7. Find A : B : C

Make B same (LCM of 5 & 6 = 30):

A : B = 24 : 30  
B : C = 30 : 35  

👉 **A : B : C = 24 : 30 : 35**

---

### Q5️⃣ If 12 workers take 10 days, how many days will 15 workers take?

Inverse proportion:

12 × 10 = 15 × x  
x = 8 days

---

### Q6️⃣ If 5 pens cost ₹20, what is cost of 8 pens?

Direct proportion:

5 → 20  
8 → x  

x = (8×20)/5 = ₹32

---

### Q7️⃣ Find third proportional to 4 and 16

b² = ac  
16² = 4 × c  
c = 64

---

### Q8️⃣ Ratio of boys to girls is 7 : 5. If boys are 28, girls?

7 → 28  
1 → 4  

Girls = 5 × 4 = **20**

---

### Q9️⃣ Salary divided between A, B, C in ratio 3 : 4 : 5. If B gets ₹4000, total salary?

4 parts = 4000  
1 part = 1000  

Total = (3+4+5) × 1000 = ₹12,000

---

### Q🔟 Increase 20% then decrease 20%. Net effect?

Shortcut:
\[
\text{Net change} = -\frac{ab}{100}
\]

= −4%  
👉 **4% decrease**

---

## 🔥 EXAM SHORTCUTS TO REMEMBER

✔ Always **reduce ratio first**  
✔ Convert word problems into ratios immediately  
✔ For workers/days → think **inverse**  
✔ For money/quantity → think **direct**  
✔ Use **unitary method** when stuck  
✔ Replace variables with **small numbers** for speed
