# 📊 AVERAGES – COMPLETE FORMULA SHEET 

---

## Basic Formula
Average = Sum / Number  
Sum = Average × Number  
Number = Sum / Average  

---

## Change in Average
Change in Average = Change in Total Sum / Number  

Increase in sum = Number × Increase in average  
Decrease in sum = Number × Decrease in average  

---

## Adding / Removing an Observation
New Average (Add) = (Old Sum + New Value) / (Old Count + 1)  
New Average (Remove) = (Old Sum − Removed Value) / (Old Count − 1)  

---

## Replacement of a Value
New Average = Old Average + (New Value − Old Value) / Number  

---

## Combined Average
Combined Average = (n₁a₁ + n₂a₂ + …) / (n₁ + n₂ + …)  

---

## Weighted Average
Weighted Average = (Σ wx) / (Σ w)  

---

## Average Speed
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time  

Equal Distances:
Average Speed = (2ab) / (a + b)  

---

## Average Age
Average Age = Total Age / Number  

After `n` Years:
New Average = Old Average + n  

Person Added/Removed:
Change in Total Age = Age Added − Age Removed  

---

## Successive Average
Total = Average × Count  
New Average = Updated Total / New Count  

---

## Missing Value
Missing Value = Required Sum − Given Sum  

---

## When Average Remains Same
Increase in values = Decrease in values  

---

## One-Glance Formula Block
Average = Sum / Count  
Sum = Average × Count  
Change in Avg = Change in Sum / Count  
Replacement Avg = Old Avg + (New − Old)/n  
Combined Avg = (n₁a₁ + n₂a₂)/(n₁+n₂)  
Weighted Avg = Σwx / Σw  
Avg Speed (Equal Distance) = 2ab/(a+b)
